Key Achievements:

Designed a multi-threaded solution to the Dining Philosophers problem.
Employed synchronization techniques to prevent deadlock and ensure fair resource allocation.
Demonstrated proficiency in concurrent programming and problem-solving.
Technologies:

C (or any language used for the implementation)
